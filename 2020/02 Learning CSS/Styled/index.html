                            Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who is among the most famous 
                            and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade, he created about 
                            2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years 
                            of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are 
                            characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed 
                            the foundations of modern art. He was not commercially successful, and his suicide at 37 came 
                            after years of mental illness, depression and poverty.

                            Hilma af Klint was a Swedish artist and mystic whose paintings were the first Western 
                            abstract art known to the current art community. A considerable body of her abstract work
                             predates the first purely abstract compositions by Kandinsky. She belonged to a group 
                             called "The Five", a circle of women inspired by Theosophy who shared a belief in the 
                             importance of trying to contact the so-called "High Masters"—often by way of séances. 
                             Her paintings, which sometimes resemble diagrams, were a visual representation of complex 
                             spiritual ideas.

                            Jasper Johns is an American painter, sculptor and 
                            printmaker whose work is associated with abstract expressionism, Neo-Dada, 
                            and pop art. He is well known for his depictions of the American flag and 
                            other US-related topics. Johns' works regularly sell for millions of dollars 
                            at sale and auction, including a reported $110 million sale in 2010. At multiple 
                            times works by Johns have held the title of most paid for work by a living artist.
