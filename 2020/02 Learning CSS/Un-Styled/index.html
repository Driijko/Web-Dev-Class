                        <h2>Vincent Van Gogh</h2>
                        <span>b. 1853 - d. 1890</span>

                        <p>
                            Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist painter 
                            who is among the most famous and influential figures in the 
                            history of Western art. In just over a decade, he created about 
                            100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which 
                            date from the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, 
                            still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by 
                            bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that 
                            contributed the foundations of modern art. He was not commercially 
                            successful, and his suicide at 37 came after years of mental illness, 
                            depression and poverty.

                        <p>
                            Hilma af Klint was a Swedish artist and mystic whose paintings 
                            were the first Western abstract art known to the current art 
                            community. A considerable body of her abstract work predates 
                            the first purely abstract compositions by Kandinsky. She 
                            belonged to a group called "The Five", a circle of women 
                            inspired by Theosophy who shared a belief in the importance of 
                            trying to contact the so-called "High Masters"—often by way 
                            of séances. Her paintings, which sometimes resemble diagrams, 
                            were a visual representation of complex spiritual ideas.
